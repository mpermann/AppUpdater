# The script is for patching an app with user notification before starting. Parameter 4 is the name of the
# app to be patched, parameter 5 is the name of the app process, parameter 6 is the policy trigger name to
# install the app. The script is relatively basic and can't currently kill more than one process or patch
# more than one app.
